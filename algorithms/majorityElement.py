# Problem:
  # Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
  # The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element
  # always exists in the array.

# Solution 1: | Time complexity is O(n), and Space Complexity is O(1). 
# Using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find most frequent integer in a given array.
